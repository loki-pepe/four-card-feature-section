## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I acquired a better understanding of Flexbox and I got introduced to the basics of CSS Grid. Also, I transitioned to using `rem` units for sizing text and defining @media queries, but I still used pixels for paddings and margins as I don't see the need for resizing them alongside the font size, as they would unnecessarily take up more screen real estate as the root font gets larger.

### Continued development

I plan on deepening my knowledge of CSS Grid via building more complex layouts.

### Useful resources

- [Learn web development by web.dev](https://web.dev/learn) - Great courses for web development basics.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - An extensive resource on everything HTML and CSS.
- [Flexbox Zombies](https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/) - A great game to get better acquainted with Flexbox.
